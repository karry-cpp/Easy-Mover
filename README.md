# Easy-Mover
A GUI app made from Python and Qt that moves all the files in just a click.

To build the app from source download and open ``main.py`` and then type ``` pip install PyQt5 ``` on cmd/terminal.

The folders can be renamed or their source can be changed also their text will be retained from last use.

Uploaded ``design.ui`` as well which is the form design of the app. To open the .ui file hit command-line/terminal with ``` pip install PyQt5Designer ``` then type ```designer``` command on command-line, go to the directory which has downloaded .ui file and then open the file.

Note :-  The .ui is just for reference to the design it won't actually change the design of the app as it is already defined in code.
